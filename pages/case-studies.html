                        <p>
                            The National Energy Affordability Tool and underlying methodology have been used 
                            in a variety of contexts, from state-level policy development to utility rate case 
                            analysis. Below are selected case studies demonstrating the tool's capabilities.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Maryland -->
                        <div class="info-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc;">
                            <h3>Maryland State Analysis</h3>
                            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Comprehensive energy affordability assessment supporting the Maryland Commission on Climate Change.</p>
                            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Used the tool to identify geographic and demographic patterns in energy burden across Maryland counties and utility territories.</p>

                            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
                            <p><em>Who is affected?</em><br>
                            Roughly 400,000 households in Maryland are energy cost burdened. Most of these households are under 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, and half of these households are renters. High rural cost burdens are driven by a reliance on expensive fuels like propane and fuel oil, while urban cost burdens are typically concentrated in historically red-lined areas. In Baltimore City, black households have nearly twice the energy cost burden compared to the rest of the city's population.</p>

                            <p><em>Solutions</em><br>
                            Maryland households collectively have an affordability gap of $400 million, only 30% of which is currently covered by bill assistance. However, implementing targeted interventions for low- and moderate-income households—such as weatherization, community solar, and demand response programs—can reduce the gap down to just $80 million, while also decarbonizing the state's energy systems. This would enable 40% of households below the poverty level to no longer require bill assistance.</p>

                            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Informed state policy recommendations for energy assistance and efficiency program targeting.</p>

                        <!-- Colorado -->
                        <div class="info-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc;">
                            <h3>Colorado Energy Equity</h3>
                            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Analysis of energy burden disparities across Colorado communities supporting the state's equity-focused clean energy transition.</p>
                            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Examined burden distributions by income, race/ethnicity, and housing type across Colorado utilities.</p>

                            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
                            <p><em>Who is affected?</em><br>
                            Across Colorado, low-income households face dramatically higher energy cost burdens, despite using less energy overall. Communities of color, renters, and those with lower average education attainment face higher energy cost burdens, even after controlling for income. Energy cost burdens are starkest in rural areas of Colorado, especially in mobile homes that are primarily heated with propane.</p>

                            <p>Rural census tracts and tracts in the coldest regions of the state also have the highest Energy Use Intensities, indicating that their homes are energy inefficient, and could benefit the most from weatherization programs that can help improve home insulation and install more energy-efficient appliances. In urban areas, higher average household heating Energy Use Intensities are found in census tracts with a higher proportion of Hispanic and Black residents have, who would also benefit from home weatherization and electrification programs.</p>

                            <p><em>Solutions</em><br>
                            Energy cost-burdens can be alleviated by equitable allocation, expansion, and enrollment efforts of existing programs and funds already dedicated to energy bill assistance and climate action. For example, funds from the Colorado Clean Energy Fund (CCEF) can help finance weatherization, electrification, community solar, and smart appliances for low-income households, which would then reduce reliance on other bill assistance programs over time.</p>

                            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Supported development of equity metrics for Colorado's climate action planning.</p>

                        <!-- Western States -->
                        <div class="info-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc;">
                            <h3>Western States Deep Decarbonization</h3>
                            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Multi-state analysis examining affordability implications of deep decarbonization pathways across the Western interconnection.</p>
                            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Modeled household-level impacts of electrification and rate changes under various decarbonization scenarios in Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico.</p>

                            <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong><br>
                            Across Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico, pollution- and energy cost-burdened communities can be targeted for clean energy infrastructure and emissions reductions programs to provide significant public health and economic benefits. Decarbonization policies that do not incorporate equity can prolong exposures to health-damaging pollutants, and increase energy and transportation costs for communities already disproportionately affected by the current fossil fuel system.</p>

                            <p>Climate policy focused solely on carbon emissions can worsen existing pollution and economic disparities. The affected communities would see some of the greatest benefits from clean energy adoption if policy focused on them. Thus, equitable decarbonization policy can then yield substantial health and economic benefits in addition to carbon benefits.</p>

                            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Identified strategies to minimize affordability impacts while achieving emission reduction goals.</p>

                            <h3>Utility Rate Case Analysis</h3>
                            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Application of affordability metrics in utility rate proceedings to assess customer impacts and design equitable rate structures.</p>
                            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Provided detailed analysis of burden distributions by customer class and demographic characteristics.</p>
