# Costs for Energy at Home
Households paid roughly \$XX billion in 2022 for electricity and fossil fuels to run their homes. Low-income households earning less than 80\% of the area median income were responsible for \$XX billion or XX\%.

# Household Budget Impacts 
XX\% of low-income households spent more than 6% of their gross income on energy. In dollar terms, $XX billion is spent annualy beyond this 6% threshold. This much would be needed in bill assistance to ensure no household spends more than 6% of their income for energy. 

# Greenhouse Gases from Homes
Occupied homes are responsible for XX tons of greenhouse gases which represent XX% of direct emissions in the US. Low-income households alone are responsible for XX and XX% respectively.

# Why this Matters
Households that struggle to pay their bills face increased risks to health and safety. Moreover, they struggle to afford the upfront costs to solutions that can reduce their bills and/or emissions. Programs such as XX and XX hold the potential to both reduce emissions and bill assistance needs, but they benefit from data informed by local data around climate, home type, and demographics such as renter status.

# Our Tool
For this reason, we developed the first tool that aggregate costs, emissions, and more. Data relies on simulated data sets of all households in 2022. With this tool, users can investigate leading impacts on costs and emisions from households. Soon to come, users can also investigate strategies to improve these outcomes.
