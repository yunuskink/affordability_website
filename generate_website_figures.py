# Greenhouse Gases from Homes
Occupied homes are responsible for XX tons of greenhouse gases which represent XX% of direct emissions in the US. Low-income households alone are responsible for XX and XX% respectively.

# Why this Matters
Households that struggle to pay their bills face increased risks to health and safety. Moreover, they struggle to afford the upfront costs to solutions that can reduce their bills and/or emissions. Programs such as XX and XX help, but they benefit from data informed by local data around climate, home type, and demographics such as renter status.

# Our Tool
For this reason, we developed the first tool to aggregate costs, emissions, and more that relies on a simulated data set of all households in 2022.
