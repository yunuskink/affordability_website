# Case Studies

Real-world applications of PSE’s Energy Affordability modeling for policy analysis, program design, and research.

## Applications of the Tool

The National Energy Affordability Tool and underlying methodology have been used in a variety of contexts, from state-level policy development to utility rate case analysis. Below are selected case studies demonstrating the tool's capabilities.

## Featured Case Studies

### Maryland State Analysis

**Context:** Comprehensive energy affordability assessment supporting the Maryland Commission on Climate Change.

**Approach:** Used the tool to identify geographic and demographic patterns in energy burden across Maryland counties and utility territories.

**Key Findings:** *Coming Soon*

**Impact:** Informed state policy recommendations for energy assistance and efficiency program targeting.

### Colorado Energy Equity

**Context:** Analysis of energy burden disparities across Colorado communities supporting the state's equity-focused clean energy transition.

**Approach:** Examined burden distributions by income, race/ethnicity, and housing type across Colorado utilities.

**Key Findings:** *Coming Soon*

**Impact:** Supported development of equity metrics for Colorado's climate action planning.

---

### Western States Deep Decarbonization

**Context:** Multi-state analysis examining affordability implications of deep decarbonization pathways across the Western interconnection.

**Approach:** Modeled household-level impacts of electrification and rate changes under various decarbonization scenarios.

**Key Findings:** *Coming Soon*

**Impact:** Identified strategies to minimize affordability impacts while achieving emission reduction goals.
