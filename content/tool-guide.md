## Decision Support Tool

The Decision Support Tool allows you to model the impacts of energy efficiency programs, weatherization initiatives, electrification policies, and rate changes on household energy costs and emissions.



### Inputs

The Input panel is where you configure the policy scenario to model. Parameters are organized into accordion sections for easy navigation.

**Accessing the inputs:**
1. Click "Open Policy Scenario" or the settings icon
2. A modal window opens with collapsible accordion sections
3. Configure parameters in each relevant section
4. Click "Run Scenario" to execute the model

> **Note:** The geography and population scope is determined by your selections in the main Existing Affordability Landscape Tool. Use the filters there to target specific regions and household types before opening the Policy Scenario modal.

#### Accordion Categories

Each accordion section contains related parameters for different types of interventions. The sections are organized into two columns:

---

##### Left Column

**� Rate Changes (Energy Prices)**

View current average rates and enter new rates to model price changes. Leave blank to keep current rate.

- **Electricity Rate** (¢/kWh): Current rate shown; enter new rate to model changes
- **Natural Gas Rate** ($/therm): Current rate shown; enter new rate to model changes
- **Propane Rate** ($/gal): Current rate shown; enter new rate to model changes
- **Fuel Oil Rate** ($/gal): Current rate shown; enter new rate to model changes

**🌱 Grid Decarbonization (CO₂e)**

Adjust the carbon intensity of electricity. This affects household emissions calculations.

- **Electricity Carbon Intensity** (kg CO₂e/kWh): Enter the emissions factor for your grid scenario
- Typical values: 0.2-0.4 for cleaner grids, 0.5-0.8 for coal-heavy grids
- Lower values = cleaner electricity

**🏠 Energy Efficiency Improvements**

Apply efficiency improvements to reduce energy consumption. Choose your preferred grouping mode:

- **By End Use** (4 sliders): All Space Heating, All Space Cooling, All Water Heating, All Appliances & Other
- **By Fuel Type** (4 sliders): Group savings by electricity, natural gas, propane, fuel oil
- **Detailed - By End Use & Fuel** (15 sliders): Granular control over each fuel/end-use combination

Each slider reduces BTU consumption by the specified percentage for participating households.

**Efficiency Program Participants:** Use the adoption selector to specify participation rates—either percentage of households or total household count.
