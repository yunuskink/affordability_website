# Burdens of Home Energy Costs

Understanding how energy costs impact household budgets, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, and create financial hardship for millions of American families.

## Costs for Energy at Home

In 2022, American households spent billions on energy to power and heat their homes:

- **Total spending:** approximately $XX billion for electricity and fossil fuels
- **Low-income households** (earning less than 80% of area median income) contributed $XX billion
- This represents **XX%** of total residential energy spending

## Household Budget Impacts

Energy costs create significant financial burdens for low-income families:

- **XX%** of low-income households spend more than 6% of gross income on energy
- This exceeds the **affordability threshold** recommended by energy assistance programs
- **Annual gap:** $XX billion spent beyond the 6% threshold
- This amount represents the bill assistance needed to achieve energy affordability

### Understanding Energy Burden

Energy burden is defined as the percentage of household income spent on energy costs. A household is considered "energy burdened" when this percentage exceeds 6%, which is the threshold used by many energy assistance programs.

## Residential Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Residential energy use is a major contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions:

- **Total emissions:** XX million tons of CO₂ equivalent from occupied homes
- This represents **XX%** of direct U.S. emissions
- Low-income households contribute **XX million tons**
- **Low-income share:** XX% of total residential emissions

## Why This Matters

Energy affordability is both a social equity and climate issue:

- **Health & Safety:** Households struggling with bills face increased risks from inadequate heating, cooling, and unsafe energy practices
- **Upfront Costs:** Low-income families cannot afford efficiency upgrades or electrification that would reduce bills and emissions
- **Program Gaps:** Weatherization, efficiency, and assistance programs exist but lack detailed local data to target investments effectively
- **Climate Justice:** Equitable solutions require understanding energy burdens across demographics and geographies
