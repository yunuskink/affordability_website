## Methodology Overview

The National Energy Affordability Tool estimates household-level energy costs, consumption, and emissions for all occupied housing units in the United States. Key methodological components include:

- **Household Simulation:** Statistical matching of survey data to create representative households
- **Energy Modeling:** End-use based estimation of electricity and fuel consumption
- **Cost Estimation:** Application of local utility rates and fuel prices
- **Emissions Calculation:** Grid emission factors and fuel combustion emissions

## Primary Data Sources

Our methodology integrates multiple authoritative data sources to achieve comprehensive coverage.

### Household Characteristics

- **American Community Survey (ACS) 2017-2021:** Demographics, income, housing characteristics
- **American Housing Survey (AHS):** Housing unit details and energy equipment

### Energy Data

- **EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS):** End-use consumption patterns
- **EIA Form 861:** Utility service territories and rates
- **EIA Form 176:** Natural gas consumption data

### Climate Data

- **NOAA:** Heating and cooling degree days by location

## Technical Documentation

Full technical documentation will be released alongside our peer-reviewed methodology paper. This will include:

- Detailed statistical matching methodology
- Energy consumption model specifications
- Rate application algorithms
- Uncertainty quantification
- Validation results
- Code and data availability
