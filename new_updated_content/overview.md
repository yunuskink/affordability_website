# Burdens of Home Energy Costs

Understanding how energy costs impact household budgets, create financial hardship for millions of American families, and contribute to climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

## Costs for Energy at Home

In 2022, American households collectively spent billions of dollars on energy to power, heat, and cool their homes:

- **Total spending:** approximately $285 billion for electricity and heating fuels  
- **Low-income households** (earning less than 80% of area median income) paid $120 billion to meet their energy needs  
- This represents **42%** of total residential energy spending

## Household Budget Impacts

Energy costs create significant financial burdens for low-income families:

- **67%** of low-income households spend more than 6% of their gross income on energy (ACEEE, 2020).  
- This exceeds the **affordability threshold** recommended by energy assistance programs  
- This means households have less money for other expenses, often forgoing medical care or other important necessities, because they **have to spend more than they should** for electricity and heat.  
- **Annual gap:** $30 billion spent beyond the 6% threshold across all households  
- This amount represents how much can be saved on household energy bills through bill assistance, energy efficiency, and improved technology.

### Understanding Energy Burden

Energy burden is defined as the percentage of household income spent on energy costs. A household is considered "energy burdened" when this percentage exceeds 6%, which is the threshold used by many energy assistance programs. Low-income households, rural households, households of color, and renters tend to have higher energy cost burdens. High energy burdens tend to be driven less by the amount of energy used and more by older, inefficient appliances, poorly-insulated homes, and expensive heating fuels (like wood or fuel oil).

## Residential Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Residential energy use is a major contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions:

- **Total emissions:** 303 million metric tons of CO₂ equivalent from home energy consumption in 2024 (US Energy Information Administration).   
- This represents **6%** of direct U.S. emissions  
- Energy use from low- to moderate-income households contributes **40%** of home energy consumption.  
- **Low-income share:** XX% of total residential emissions, indicating major opportunities to cut emissions while alleviating high bill burdens.

## Why This Matters

Energy affordability is both a social equity and climate issue:

- **Health & Safety:** Households struggling with bills face increased risks from inadequate heating, cooling, and unsafe energy practices (like using the oven for heating).  
- **Upfront Costs:** Low-income families cannot afford efficiency upgrades or electrification that would reduce bills and emissions  
- **Program Gaps:** Weatherization, efficiency, and assistance programs exist but lack detailed local data to target investments effectively  
- **Energy Equity:** Equitable solutions require understanding energy burdens across different demographics and geographies
